# User Replaceability Prediction Agent

## Project Vision
This project aims to predict the replaceability of a user's work by AI and automation. It explores both conservative and progressive scenarios to provide a comprehensive analysis of future career viability.

## High-Level Idea
The core application will analyze a user's job profile, decompose it into specific tasks, and evaluate the potential for automation for each task. This provides a granular view of how much of the user's role could be impacted by technological advancements.

## Current Status
- **Job Decomposition**: The initial step involves breaking down a job profile (title, description, routine) into a structured list of constituent tasks with their respective time shares.
